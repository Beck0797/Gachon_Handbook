# Gachon_Handbook
When I was a freshman, I found it difficult to get used to a completely new education system, with new rules and new grading policies. Moreover, it was quite confusing to find the right building on a big campus.

Now, I am super excited to introduce you the ["Gachon Students Handbook"](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_scheduler_gachon.handbook_nav_merge
). This app can be a handbook and guide for every Gachon University International Student. After reading the guide students will be familiar with rules, the Gachon campus, important apps, and most importantly with the education system of the university.

I made the app using the [MIT app inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu) which was introduced to us during the "Creative N-Tree camp" at the end of the semester.I have uploaded the aia file of the app so anyone who wants to contribute to the app, can download and make their contributions.
